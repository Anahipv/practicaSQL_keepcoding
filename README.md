# Data Model for a Car Rental Company 

## Project for KeepCoding's SQL course

Objectives:

    Design a normalized ER model for a car rental company
    Load the data into the tables
    Create a SQL query that, for each car, gives us:
        it's model, brand and the company that owns said brand
        it's purchase date
        it's license plate
        it's color
        it's mileage
        it's insurance number
        the name of the insurance company where the car is insured
